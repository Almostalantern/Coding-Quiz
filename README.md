# Coding-Quiz
This is a quiz I am making about web design that asks a few fairly easy general knowledge questions about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The quiz is ten questions long and is multiple choice. This quiz isn't designed to be difficult, rather something slightly amusing that also makes sure that you understand some truly basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

# Motivation 
This quiz is less of a serious test of someone's abilities and more of a way for me nail down Javascript using DOM commands and to make sure that I can get code running smoothly. My goal was to see if I could get all of my cards to hide or appear upon command. I plan on adding a timer and a score display, even if I haven't figured either one out quite yet.
